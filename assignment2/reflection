When creating a style checker using first object oriented programming and then functional programming, the main difference was the use of classes and methods. The first time, I had all of my methods inside of a class and I had attributes of the class. This allowed me to call each method at once and I appended the results of each method to a file as the program went. I had to think differently when creating the style checker using functional programming because each method would have to be called individually. Now, I have each method returning its output as a line and the analyze_file method calls each individually. Instead of calling the class, the analyze_file method will be called in order to process the program.
